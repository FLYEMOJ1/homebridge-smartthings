# Smartthings Homebridge Plugin 

This is yet another smartthings plugin for Homebridge.  This requires no access to the legacy smartthings app, and doesn't
require a lot of work to install.  It will discover devices automatically as well as unregister devices that are removed
from your smarttthings network.  This is currently under development.

## Device types supported

Currently, the following have been implemented, because that is what I have access to in my home.  If you have other 
types you would like me to add, contact me at iklein99@comcast.net.

## How to configure

TBD.
